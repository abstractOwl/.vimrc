# My `.vimrc` backup
Mostly for sync-ing between computers, but feel free to use/steal!

## Installation
This `.vimrc` uses the Vundle plugin manager which you will need to grab from here https://github.com/gmarik/vundle. After that, type `:BundleInstall` into Vim and it'll do the rest!

Automate the installation with the `setup.sh` script included!

## Plugins
* `vundle` -- Plugin manager
* `molokai` -- Playful colorscheme
* `jellybeans` -- Extra colorscheme for noctural coding
* `vim-easymotion` -- For zooming through documents
* `scrooloose/syntastic` -- Catch those pesky syntax errors
* `vim-powerline` -- Shiny status bar
